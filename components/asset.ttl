    An Asset may have different identifiers assigned to it by different parties.
    The identities are not necessarily equivalent even though they have been assigned to the same Asset.
    Each identity has a type, such as ISBN or EIDR and the type is semantically defined.
    Identities that alsoIdentifiedBy refer to MUST be for the whole Asset and not for part of the Asset.
    	For example if the Asset is a book, the alsoIdentifiedBy ids will be for the book and NOT for pictures in the book.
