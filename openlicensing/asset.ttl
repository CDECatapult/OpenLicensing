         alsoIdentifiedBy is used to refer to code that are used to identify the asset 
         in different context. As codes, and identifiers are given to object in different
         context, it is not considered that there is a semantic equality between the different
         identifiers used to refer to an asset, however it is assumed that :
           1. Knowing the type of an asset and its identifier shall be completely unambiguous.
           2. Except for algorithmic ideas used for content retrieval,  
               that identifier necessarily refer to the whole asset and not to parts of the asset, that may
              have their own identifiers, but that cannot be associated with it.
              (I.e. in general the asset is fully included in the "alsoIdentifiedBy" asset,
                    and we cannot use and "alsoIdentifiedBy" for something that is actually
                    only included in the asset)
              
          For instance, it is ok to use
            - the ISBN of book to refer to a text that is the main content of the book
              although the book it self may actually contain more creative works: typography, illustrations,...
              The book is semantically slightlt larger than the text it self but can be assumed connected with the 
              the text.
            
          Oppositely it is not ok to use :
            - the name of a Poem to refer to an entire book, as the poem may later be included in other books.
            - it is not ok to use the id of a song to refer to CD - even if distributor current has exclusivity.
            - it is not ok to use ISBN of a book to refer to a text if the book contain only a part a portion of the text. 
            
          However, it is currently accepted that a visual feature/hash used for content retrieval can be used to designate
             a whole although this hash is only based on a part of a creation.
