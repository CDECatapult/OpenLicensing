Open Licensing Ontology
=======================

This is an extension of the ODRL 2.1 Ontology to support the Open Licensing Platform.

Todo:
=====
* review how we version the ontology
* describe in this document the versioning naming convention
* remove ns1:
* Replace blank nodes/weird ids
* Remove Countries from this ontology, select a suitable external ontology that specialises in this
* Monk ontology dependency, is this required?
* Language notation on descriptive strings
* Check all owl constraints used and limit them to remain at least with the RL profile
* There are some ASSET ID TYPES defined, needs reviewing, instance vs class
* some terms from ODRL have been 'deprecated', this needs reviewing and justification/decision detailed in this document.
* Many ODRL terms have been redefined in this ontology in order to support serialisation via Monk ... review this.
* Some ids are not valid, needs fixing
* the dependencies we have on other ontologies should be described and justified in this document
* some of the ontologies in our dependency folder have been modified (reduced in size) this should be documented in this document
